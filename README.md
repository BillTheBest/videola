Videola
=======

Videola is a base installation profile for creating a video portal website
using [Drupal](http://drupal.org). This package consists of a .make file which
can download all dependencies of the profile using 
[Drush Make](http://drupal.org/project/drush_make) and an installation profile 
which hinges off of the excellent 
[Profiler](http://drupal.org/project/profiler).

Profiler itself is going through some major changes and is under active 
development. It is currently a profile itself but will soon be transitioning
to a fully fledged module. Check out the project page for more.

Videoloa currently uses [Ooyala](http://www.ooyala.com) as it's hosted video solution of choice. The
[Ooyala module](http://drupal.org/project/ooyala) is under active development.
